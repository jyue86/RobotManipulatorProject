# RobotManipulatorProject

This is a project that is being used to introduce us to the world of manipulation through the Drake Library.
Currently building up the software to enable robotic arm grasping.

To start the simulation, go to the `opt/drake/bin` or wherever your drake installation is located, and run
the `meldis` executable. This will open a new meshcat tab at `localhost:7000`. Then, run one of the 
generated executables from the build process, and you should see your simulation running in meshcat.
